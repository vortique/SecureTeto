# SecureTeto
> Kasane Teto's encrypted file storage solution for storing her precious baguette images.

**SecureTeto** is a fast, secure, and user-friendly encrypted file storage program written with C (for backend, archiving etc.) and Python (for GUI, PyQt6).

It allows users to create encrypted containers (vaults) that can be accessed securely from Python GUI, providing seamless access to encrypted files.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**SecureTeto** is in **early development**. Currently working on:
- Basic archive format implementation
- Core encryption functionality

Not ready for production use yet!

## Roadmap

- [x] Design unique archive format for encrypted vaults
- [ ] Implement archive creation and extraction
- [ ] Command-line interface (CLI) for vault management

### In future releases...

- [ ] Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Mountable encrypted vaults as virtual drives
