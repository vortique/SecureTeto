# SecureTeto
> Kasane Teto's encrypted file storage solution for storing her precious baguette images.

**SecureTeto** is a fast, secure, and user-friendly encrypted file storage program written with C (for backend, archiving etc.) and Python (for GUI, PyQt6).

It allows users to create encrypted containers (vaults) that can be accessed securely from Python GUI, providing seamless access to encrypted files.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**SecureTeto** is in **early development**. Currently working on:
- GUI design and implementation
- Adding more features to the C backend for vault management, enc/dec and binding to Python.

Not ready for production use yet!

## Early screenshots of the Python GUI (subject to change):
